Requirements & Setup
--------------------
1) This version of Sun Flares only works with High Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP 7.1.8 or later).
2) Make sure you have High Definition RP package imported in the project before importing Sun Flares to avoid compilation errors.
3) Make sure you have a High Definition RP asset assigned to Project Settings / Graphics. There's a HDRP sample asset in Demo folder.
4) Assign Sun Flares to the "After Post Process" list in Project Settings / HDRP Default Settings.
